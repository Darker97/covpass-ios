# Changelog
<!--- 
  DON'T write anything here - use the sections below :-)
  
  This part will be automatically added to the `CHANGELOG.md` files of the components.
  The changelogs will be consumed by _external_ companies (e.g. TK). 
  Describe  what has changed in terms _they_ can understand.
  Keep in mind, that `eGA` consumers have a different view than `PlatformUI` consumers.
  If any action is required on their side, describe what needs to be done.

  Format/Examples:
    - [major] Add `Foo` dependency to `Bar` to be able to do amazing things (EBH-1234).
      When instantiating `Bar` you now also need to pass in an instance of `Foo`.
      The provided shared instance `Foo.shared` can be used.
      To really do amazing things, the feature flag `AMAZING` needs to be activated.
    - [minor] Add an option to `FancyCustomView` to specify the font size (EBH-4321).
    - [patch] Fixed a race condition that cause the request of `PoorObjects` to fail sometimes (EBH-2324).
